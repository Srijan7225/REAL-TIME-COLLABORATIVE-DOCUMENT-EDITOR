*DESCRIPTION*:

This project is a web-based application where multiple users can type and edit the same document at the same time. It works like Google Docs but in a simpler form.

#Key Features:
1. Collaborative Editing
Many users can write in the same document at once.
Changes appear instantly for everyone.

2. Rich Text Editor
Built with Quill.js for bold, italic, underline, and other formatting.
User-friendly and easy to type in.

3. Realtime Updates
Uses WebSockets to send changes immediately.
No need to refresh the page.

4. Responsive UI
Clean and modern design with React.
Works smoothly on desktops and laptops.

#Tech Stack:
1. Frontend (UI): React.js + Vite + Quill.js
2. Backend (API + WebSocket): Node.js + Express + ShareDB
3. Database: MongoDB (to store documents)

#How It Works:
1. User opens the editor in their browser.
2. React loads the Quill editor on the page.
3. When the user types, the text is sent to the backend through WebSockets.
4. ShareDB syncs changes across all connected users.
5. MongoDB stores the final document.
